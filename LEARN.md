## Introduction 

This repository contains projects that I developed while I was learning about malware development. It does not encourage illegality in any way, but is only prepared for people who are interested in this field to take a look at my projects. 

The repository content is as follows:

- `游릭` [**DLL Injection**](https://github.com/x1nerama/maldev/tree/main/Process%20Injection/DLL%20Injection)
    - `游릭` [DLL Injection with Assembly](https://github.com/x1nerama/maldev/tree/main/Process%20Injection/DLL%20Injection/DLL%20Injection%20with%20Assembly)
    - `游릭` [DLL Injection with C/C++](https://github.com/x1nerama/maldev/tree/main/Process%20Injection/DLL%20Injection/DLL%20Injection%20with%20C) 
- `游릭` [**Using NTDLL**](https://github.com/x1nerama/maldev/tree/main/Process%20Injection/NTAPI%20Injection)
    - `游릭` [NTAPI Injection with Assembly](https://github.com/x1nerama/maldev/tree/main/Process%20Injection/NTAPI%20Injection/NTAPI%20Injection%20with%20Assembly)
    - `游릭` [NTAPI Injection with C/C++](https://github.com/x1nerama/maldev/tree/main/Process%20Injection/NTAPI%20Injection/NTAPI%20Injection%20with%20C) 

People who have enough C knowledge and at least enough Assembly knowledge to read can easily take a look at my projects.
